# CRD
The CRD dataset consists of various parameters collected from a steel company in China, representing real-world industrial scenarios. It includes nine types of  parameters includees:rolling forces, bending force, rolling speed, tension, Entry set thickness, Thick_EX, width, Entry actual thickness and Exit actual thickness.The dataset contains ten rolls of steel strip with different widths and thicknesses, totaling approximately 15,000 samples.The dataset details are as follows:

    MRT-1：It contains two coils of steel, with the thickness of the coils varying from 3.00 to 0.352 mm at the inlet and outlet, and the strip width is 1000 mm, totaling 4566 samples.
    MRT-5： The thickness of the coil at the inlet and outlet ranged from 3.000 to 0.333 mm, and the width of the strip was 853 mm. There were a total of 1611 samples. 
    MRT-3： The thickness of the coil at the inlet and outlet ranged from 1.800 to 0.181 mm, and the width of the strip was 853 mm. There were a total of 2810 samples. 
    MRT-4：The thickness of the coil at the inlet and outlet ranged from 2.750 to 0.282 mm, and the width of the strip was 1250 mm. There were a total of 1875 samples.
    Q195L：The thickness of the coil at the inlet and outlet ranged from 3.000 to 1.019 mm, and the width of the strip was 1250 mm. There were a total of 922 samples.
